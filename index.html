      <p> Hi, I'm Mohamed Abdikarim, welcome to my corner of the web. As a dedicated student at Pivosoft Coding Academy,
        I'm on a thrilling journey to master the art of coding. Every line of code I write is a step closer to turning
        my ambitious dreams into reality. With a burning passion for technology, I'm continuously exploring new realms
        of programming, ready to tackle any challenge that comes my way. I hold a degree in Cyber Security from the
        International Business, Science and Technology University. Recently, I furthered my expertise by earning
        certifications in CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+, and Cisco CCNA. With a solid foundation in both theoretical
        knowledge and practical skills, I am committed to advancing my career in this dynamic field. My passion for
        continuous learning drives me to seek new challenges and opportunities, ensuring that this journey in the world
        of cyber security is just the beginning. In my free time, I indulge in various activities that bring me joy and
        fulfillment. I enjoy reading the Holy Quran, which brings me peace and guidance. I am also fascinated by
        historical events, immersing myself in the stories and lessons of the past. Watching football is another passion
        of mine, as I love the excitement and strategy of the game. Lastly, I cherish spending quality time with my
        family, making memories and strengthening our bond.</p>
